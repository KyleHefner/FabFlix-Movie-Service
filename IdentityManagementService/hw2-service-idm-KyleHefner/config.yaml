# YAML config files consist of groupings of affiliated key:value pairs, which can be parsed using Jackson. Just like how
# Jackson maps JSON strings to POJOs, Jackson maps YAML config files to POJOs. The YAML config is the textual
# representation of the data (that is to say, the parameters we want to use to configure out microservice. The POJO
# representation of the data is a Map<String,String>. The ConfigsModel class consists of two Map<String,String> objects
# corresponding to the two groups below:

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The service config parameters are used to configure your microservice's Grizzly HTTP server.
#   scheme: This is the protocol our request will be using. The values will be http:// or https://

#   hostName: This is the name of the host which your service is running on. Remember, hostName can be either an IP
#             address OR a domain name. A value of 0.0.0.0 tells the HTTP server to accept requests destined for ANY
#             IPv4 address. This is a HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PRACTICE! You should ALWAYS use the IP address of the computer
#             your application is running on.
#
#   port: This is the port number your application listens on. It should be the LAST 4 DIGITS OF OUR STUDENT ID# simply
#         to avoid port conflicts. If you all stick with using the example # of 6243 you're going to run in to port
#         conflicts and your web server won't be able to run.
#
#   path: This is the resource path to which the HTTP server will accept inbound traffic.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
serviceConfig:
  scheme: http://
  hostName: 0.0.0.0
  port: 3991
  path: /api/idm

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The logger config parameters are used to configure the logging within your microservice.
#   outputDir: This is the directory to which all of your log files will be written.
#
#   outputFile: This is the file to which all of your log statements will be written.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
